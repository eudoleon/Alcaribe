To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to **Contacts > Contacts**
#. Create a record and uncheck the "Selectable in purchase orders" box on the Purchase part of the "Sales & Purchases" tab.

The "Selectable in purchase orders" field is set to True by default. To change this default to False, adjust the system parameter
'purchase_partner_selectable_option.default_purchase_selectable' by setting it to "0".
